How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

Answer: I can ensure that my code, program, or software is functional through extensive testing and the use of several testing techniques. Some of these tests include, unit testing, integration testing, performance testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. Using these testing types and techniques ensures that what I am coding is error free and meets all requirements

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

At the end of the day, the end-user is the person (or people) you are creating this software for, if it doesn't do what they want it to do, what was the point of creating it in the first point. Software is usually created to solve a problem or make an existing process more efficient, therefore it is imperative that the software meets requirements or it will not be solving any of the problems or making any of the existing processes any better.

How do I approach designing software? 

I approach designing, with the goal of clarity and transparency between myself and the client. I like to ensure that I completely and clearly understand what the client wants out of thier software. This clarity and understanding of what is expected curbs misunderstandings, and ensures that the code can do what the client wants to do without running into issues.
